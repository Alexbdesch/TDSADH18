LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 24---Troops from the Army's crack 101st Airborne Division, carrying carbines and billy clubes, took posts around Central High School tonight. They were here to see that court-ordered integration is carried out.

With police sirens wailing and headlights flashing, Army trucks loaded with soldiers roared into position. The soldiers represented about a quarter of the contigent of 1,000 crack troops of the division that was ordered to Little Rock by President Eisenhower to prevent mob riots and violence.
