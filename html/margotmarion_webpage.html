This page is to be used as the template for your own HTML page.  This content at the top is considered a "comment" and will not display
when the web page is viewed online. The "tags" that surround this text is what causes the text to be interpreted as a comment.  HTML
works via the use of tags, which usually come in pairs; an opening tag and a closing tag.  HTML tags are identified as tags by the 
"<" and ">" symbols; the tag goes between the opening symbol (<) and the closing symbol (>).  The opening tag is usually text, and the 
closing tag usually consists of a forward slash (/) followed by the same text that is in the opening tag.  But not always. Comment tags 
are an example of something different. Comments are used in the rest of this page to describe the code that follows each comment.

<!--
The next line is a a special tag that is not really HTML. It tells web browsers that the rest of this page is a particular type of HTML
(the current version is HTML 5), so the browser knows how to display the content. It does not have a closing tag.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
Now the actual HTML tags start. Notice that the next tag (<html>) tells the browser "here is where the HTML starts."  At the bottom of 
this document, you will this tag: </html>.  The forward slash (/) is HTML code for "end."  As noted above, almost but not all HTML tags
come in pairs like this.
-->
<html>
  	
	<!--
	The <head> tag sets the header for the page. Headers include metadata that indicate what type of formatting should be used
	among other things. Also note that indenting is used each time an opening  tag is used, then the indenting is reduced when the 
	closing tag is used. This helps make the page more clear to the coder.
	-->
	<head> 
		
		<!--
		The next tag is a metadata tag instructing browsers to use the Unicode protocol for interpreting characters. Unicode is
		a common standard that is used for virtually all web pages. This tag does not have a closing tag.
		-->
		<meta charset="utf-8">  
    		
		<!--
		The next tag sets the title. This is displayed in the browser tab. Change it to the title of your page.
		-->
		<title>       
			HTML Template
		</title> 
		<!--
		The tag above this closes the title.
		-->
		
		<!--
		The next tag is another special tag without a closing tag; this one tells the page where to find formatting instructions.
		The instructions are in anoteher file in this repository. The file is a "Cascading Style Sheet", in the "styles" folder.
		The file name ends with ".css" and contains HTML code in a special format.  It is what determines the font size and 
		color, what a link should look like, what the margins of the page should be, what the background should look like; in 
		fact, the style sheet can describe every visual element of the page. (Browsers have default values that will be used if 
		the style sheet does not explicitly say what to use).  You should make a new style sheet for your page, and change this 
		line so your style sheet will be used. (Make sure your style sheet is inside the styles folder.)

    		<link href="../styles/margotmarion_webpage.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
		
		<!--
		Another special tag; similar to the last one, but this one creates the little image in the page's tab; the "faviocon."
		-->
		<link href="../images/hfav.png" rel="icon" type="image/png">
		
	<!--
	The next tag closes the header.
	-->
  	</head>
	
	<!--
	The next tag starts the body of the web page.  The content inside the body tags is what is displayed online.
	-->
	<body>
		
		<!--
		The <h1> tag is the "big headline" tag.  Your style sheet will determine how the big headlines are displayed, and what
		they should look like (these include "shadows"). There are tags for smaller headlines as well (<h2>, <h3>, etc).
		-->
		<h1>
			HTML Template <!--This is the big headline to be displayed-->
		</h1>
		
		<!--
		The <p> tag creates a paragraph with formatting determined by your style sheet. Use a <div> tag to format code that isn't
		in a paragraph (or to format collections of paragraphs). <div> means "division" and is used to group other elements
		together. After the <p> tag is text that will be displayed on the web page, in a paragraph.

		 Customers spilled out of Elk Candy onto the sidewalk in front of 240 East 86th Street a week before Easter. More than 500 a day were coming for homemade marzipan and chocolate confections -- bunnies, eggs and pigs. A sign in the window said the 64-year-old shop was closing for good.1

 ''The line wouldn't break,'' said Anton Lulgjuraj, the 24-year-old owner, who inherited the shop from his father.  All that was left on the shelves that bleak, snowy afternoon were paper doilies and a few boxes of prepackaged chocolates. Relatives and friends helped him clean up and move fixtures and machinery into storage.  Elk, which closed last Monday, was the last holdout of the Montgomery, a row of four-story tenements built in 1883, and the penultimate vestige of German Broadway, as East 86th Street was known. Dozens of German establishments, including Kleine Konditorei, Cafe Geiger, the Lorelei dance hall, the Platzl restaurant and Cafe Wienecke, are gone. Only Ideal Restaurant is left on 86th Street, between First and Second Avenues, where it relocated two years ago after a fire. Several German establishments remain in other parts of Yorkville.2

 A developer, the Related Companies, bought the Montgomery and the six-story Manhattan, No. 244, next to it, from FGH Realty in February. The developer expects demolition of the Montgomery to begin this week. A 22-story luxury building with 245 rentals and 40,000 square feet of retail space is to be built on the site by the end of 1998.

 ''I don't know where I'm going to get marzipan for Oma now,'' said Arturo Gruenebaum, 29, referring to his grandmother. He sadly entered the empty shop with his cousins, Nancy and Anthony Weiss of Tampa, Fla. and a friend, Anusch Cutujian, of Hamburg, Germany.  "I came in to get marzipan piggies for my niece," said Mr. Weiss who stopped by whenver she was in town.  ''This is marzipan,'' Mr. Gruenebaum said. ''It was an institution.''

 Mr. Lulgjaraj, of Albanian descent, inherited the secrets of marzipan and chocolate- making from his father, Leka, who worked at Elk for 27 years, and bought it from Swiss-born Albert W. Hadener in 1990. Mr. Hadener bought the shop from the original owners, the Kramers, in 1961. Elk stands for Elizabeth and Ludwig Kramer. Mr. Lulgjaraj said he would look for another site in Yorkville to reopen.

 Among the last customers was Kathy Jolowicz, a Yorkville historian. She picked up two cartloads of candy for the Zion St. Mark's Church's spring bazaar on Saturday. Ms. Jolowicz, who grew up in Yorkville, recalled little care packages her mother used to sent her several decades ago at boarding school in Tarrytown.

 ''She sent me chocolate candies,'' Ms. Jolowicz said, ''with different colored sprinkles -- nonpareils -- and lebkuchen.

 Jane Schnitzer, who moved to the neighborhood in 1974, always gave her eldest daughter, Annabel, marzipan for Easter2, Christmas and Valentine's Day.

 ''I literally raised her on marzipan,'' said Ms. Schnitzer, whose daughter went to Brearley, on 83d Street, and is now a freshman at Barnard College. ''An awful lot of kids at Brearley will be disappointed.'' 2ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY
