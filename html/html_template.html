(the current version is HTML 5), so the browser knows how to display the content
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
Now the actual HTML tags start. Notice that the next tag (<html>) tells the browser "here is where the HTML starts."  At the bottom of this 
document, you will this tag: </html>.  The forward slash (/) is HTML code for "end."  Almost all HTML tags come in pairs like this.
