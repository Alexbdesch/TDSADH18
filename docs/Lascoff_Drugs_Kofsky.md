&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By GAY TALESE


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a serene brownstone. <br/>
on Lexington Avenue, on the. <br/>
corner of Eighty-second Street,<br/>
a 59-year-old pharmacist named<br/>
Frederick  D.  Lascoff  has spe-<br/>
cialized for years  in  selling<br/>
leeches to battered prize-fight-<br/>
ers, catnip oil to lion hunters<br/>
and thousands of strange po-<br/>
tions to people in exotic places<br/>
around the world.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lascoff drugstore, which<br/>
celebrated its sixtieth anniver-<br/>
sary last week, is a  Gothic-<br/>
styled apothecary shop whose<br/>
walls are lined with more than<br/>
50,000 bottles containing every-<br/>
thing from Acacia to zinc.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be inferred from<br/>
the foregoing that Mr. Lascoff's<br/>
apothecary shop  carries  only<br/>
rare herbs and weird pills; far<br/>
from it. the bulk of its business <br/>
comes from standard prescrip-<br/>
tions. But through the years J.<br/>
Leon Lascoff & Son has made a<br/>
reputation for producing bi-<br/>
zarre concotions when re-<br/>
quested.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighters Steady Customers
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prize-fighters wishing to have<br/>
blood sucked from their facial <br/>
wounds have been some of Mr. <br/>
Lascoff's  steadiest  customers.<br/>
And when the African explorer <br/>
Martin  Johnson  was  off  to<br/>
hunt  lions,  he  first equipped <br/>
himself with catnnip oil from the <br/>
druggist. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the most unusual <br/>
requests  came from another <br/>
drugstore  owner, who  once <br/>
wrote Mr. Lascoff to ask: "Can <br/>
you please tell me what I can<br/>
do to make my drugstore smell<br/>
like  a  drug  store?"  Seems<br/>
that food odors in his establish-<br/>
ment overpowered the desirable<br/>
"drugstore smell."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Mr. Lascoff evolved  a<br/>
formula  of  phenol,  valerian, <br/>
asafetida and iodoform;  and,<br/>
sure enough, it gave forth a <br/>
drugstore scent. <br/>
