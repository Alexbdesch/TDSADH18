86th Street Loses German Holdout And Its Marzipan
===

   Customers spilled out of Elk Candy onto the sidewalk in front of 240 East 86th Street a week before Easter. More than 500 a day were coming for homemade marzipan and chocolate confections -- bunnies, eggs and pigs. A sign in the window said the 64-year-old shop was closing for good.
   ''The line wouldn't break,'' said Anton Lulgjuraj, the 24-year-old owner, who inherited the shop from his father.
