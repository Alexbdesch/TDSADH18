&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By GAY TALESE


&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a serene brownstone. 
on Lexington Avenue, on the. 
corner of Eighty-second Street,  

a 59-year-old pharmacist named

Frederick D. Lascoff has spe-
cialized for years in selling
leeches to battered prize-fight-
ers, catnip oil to lion hunters
and thousands of strange po-
tions to people in exotic places
around the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lascoff drugstore, which
celebrated its sixtieth anniver-
sary last week, is a Gothic-
styled apothecary shop whose
walls are lined with more than
50,000 bottles containing every-
thing from Acacia to zinc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be inferred from
the foregoing that Mr. Lascoff's
apothecary shop carries only
rare herbs and weird pills; far
from it. the bulf of its business comes from standard prescrip-
tions. But through the years J.
Leon Lascoff & Son has made a
reputation for producing bi-
zarre concotions when re-
quested.
