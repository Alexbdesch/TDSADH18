**For the Markdown/HTML Practicum, the class will use GitHub to collaborate in creating a web site composed primarily of transcribed historical archives.**

Choices to be made/Questions to Answer:

1. Do we focus on Markdown only (including small amounts of html)?

   If so, students will create and add (a) document(s) to their repository.
   Or, in addtion to markdown, they can also create an HTML page that links to their markdown.  This way, they can also experiment with CSS for styling.

2. What specific editing techniques should be explored?

   For example, if the students are transcribing newspaper articles, they might be asked to get as close to the original as possible by using headline text/font, indenting of paragraphs, lists with numbers, including photos, etc. 
   Are footnotes required? Optional?
   Other formatting requirements/options?

3. What item type(s) are acceptable/required?

   Newspaper articles?  Descriptions of physical items?  Letters/correspondence?  usw...

Practicum Preparation Steps
---

1. Create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)

   Use your school username and email address.
   
2. Find the **TDSADH18 repository** owned by sgolanka [or use this direct link](https://github.com/sgolanka/TDSADH18)

   A [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) is a collection of files and folders saved on GitHub. It contains all of the resources used in a project.
   
3. **Fork** the repository by clicking the Fork icon in the upper right, and then click on your account name in the resulting pop-up window.

   To [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) a repository is to make a copy of it in you own account. The copy "remembers" where it came from, so you can merge your fork back to the original repository. This is one of the fundamental ways GitHub can be used for collaboration (it also keeps track of each change).
   
You now haave a repository that you can edit!
---

We'll be transcribing documents using [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#markdown), as well as creating a web page using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets).

Practicum Requirements and Techniques
---

**Creating a document using Markdown (you must transcribe 1 newpaper article):**

1. Navigate to the docs folder (in your repository, click on docs).

2. Create a new file in this folder (click Create New); give it a name describing your transcription, and add **.md** at the of the file name. This indicates that the file will be created using Markdown.

3. Edit the document.  Each time you make a set of edits, you will [commit](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit) the changes by entering a note about what you did (added link, fixed spelling error, etc.) and clicking **Commit** at the bottom of the page. Use the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) reference for help.

4. When you are satisfied that you have finished your edits, create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request).  this will notify the owner of the original repository that you are ready for your changes and additions to be merged into the master project.  Click **Pull Request** at the top of your repository, then **New Pull Request** then **Create Pull Request**.

**Creating a new [HTML](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#markdown) Page**

1. Navigate to the **HTML** folder in your repository, and click on it to enter the folder.

2. Create a new file in this folcer (click Create New); give it a name (your username is fine), and add **.html** at the end of the file name. This indicates the file will be created using HTML.

3. Use the index.html page as a guide...(can provide a template to get started)

4. Use CSS?

5. Include link to markdown?

6. Pull request after this, not after markdown, if doing this.
