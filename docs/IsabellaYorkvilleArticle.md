  Yorkville, once a grity working-class neighborhood of German, Irish, and Hungarian immigrants, is gradually becoming part of the Upper East Side to which it had long been attached more by geography than character. The changes are perhaps best revealed not by the impact studies ofurban planners, but by taking a walk.
   Croissants appeared a few weeks ago at Glaser's Bake Shop on the corner of First Avenue and 87th Street, where for eight decades the same family has been making linzer tortes and German coffee cakes. The cozy old bar on the corner of Third Avenue and 91st Street has been transformed into a singles cafe called Mumbles, and a few blocks down Third Avenue computers are being sold in what not too long ago was an Irish grocery.

   Developers now are planning to add at least eight more that will bring thousands of new residents, many of them middle- and upper-middle-class people who themselves are in flight from even higher housing costs in other parts of Manhattan.
   This kind of redevelopment already has occured in what some residents think of as the southern party of Yorkville, the east-of-Third-Avenue blocks between 79th and 86th Streets, but now it is moving uptown.
   "The city has moved north, the pressures have moved north," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat-Liberal who represents the district. "Now this area is a prie real-estate area. In the next 10 years, it's going to become very chic and expensive - like the rest of the Upper East Side." 
   Within a decade, according to Mr. Robbins, the
