**For the Markdown/HTML Practicum, the class will use GitHub to collaborate in creating a web site composed primarily of transcribed historical archives.**

Choices to be made/Questions to Answer:

1. Do we focus on Markdown only (including small amounts of html)?

   If so, students will create and add (a) document(s) to their repository.
   Or, in addtion to markdown, they can also create an HTML page that links to their markdown.  This way, they can also experiment with CSS for styling.

2. What specific editing techniques should be explored?

   For example, if the students are transcribing newspaper articles, they might be asked to get as close to the original as possible by using headline text/font, indenting of paragraphs, lists with numbers, including photos, etc. 
   Are footnotes required? Optional?
   Other formatting requirements/options?

3. What item type(s) are acceptable/required?

   Newspaper articles?  Descriptions of physical items?  Letters/correspondence?  usw...

Lab Preparation Steps
---

1. Create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)

   Use your school username and email address.
   
2. Find the **TDSADH18 repository** owned by sgolanka [or use this direct link](https://github.com/sgolanka/TDSADH18)

   A [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) is a collection of files and folders saved on GitHub. It contains all of the resources used in a project.
   
3. **Fork** the repository by clicking the Fork icon in the upper right, and then click on your account name in the resulting pop-up window.

   To [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) a repository is to make a copy of it in you own account. The copy "remembers" where it came from, so you can merge your fork back to the original repository. This is one of the fundamental ways GitHub can be used for collaboration (it also keeps track of each change).
