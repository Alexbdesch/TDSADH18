&nbsp;**Martha Graham Gives Original Dance Recital**

&nbsp;Martha Graham, known as America's greatest dancer, gave a solo recital Sunday evening in the Theresa L. Kaufmann Auditorium of the Y.M.H.A., 92nd St. and Lexington Ave. Miss Graham used music by modern composers exclusively as accompaniment for her dances, and the desigs, materials and color combinations of her costumes were all of her own creation.
