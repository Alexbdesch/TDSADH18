 <b>C</b>all the city and suburban 
Homes a block of tenements and it
does not seem like a natural can-
didate for landmark status. Call it 
utopian housing, however, and it 
begins to look a lot better. And utopian
housing is recisely what this is - since this 
sprawling series of structures, which runs 
along the south side of 79th Street from York 
Avenue to the East River, is one of the most 
ambitious attempts in the history of New
York to create viable housing for the poor. 
Together with its neighboring complex, the 
Cherokee Apartments, the City and 
Subruban Homes stands as perhaps our
greatest legacy from a critical moment in 
both the architectural and social history of 
the city - a monument to the moment 
when a solution to the city's housing prob-
lems actually seemed possible. 
In he first decade of this century, when the 
1,300-unit complex was erected, the city 
faced a catastrophic housing crisis. 
Cramped, dark and dirty tenements were the 
norm for the city's poor, many of whom lived 
in the conditions that can barely be called civi-
lized. Social reformers took up the cause of 
better housing, and - often backed by money 
from philanthropists - commissioned archi-
tects to find alternatives to the traditional 
tenement building. The City and Suburban
Homes, the major project of a limited-profit
company underwritten by members of 
the Astor, Lewisohn, Auchincloss, Rockefel-
ler and Iselin families, was the largest of the 
so-called model tenements built in New York, 
and one of the best. This group of six-sto-
ry walk-up buildings, erected around a series
of private courtyards, was designed to assure
every family light, air, privacy, and a sense of 
space. To an urban environment that had 
symbolized only harshness to many people, 
this complex brought dignity and joy. 

All of this is significant today because the 
City and Suburban Homes, which as gone on 
housing people well for the better part of a 
century, is now threatened. An island of 
working-class people in the midst of the very 
gentrified Upper East Side, it may well give 
way to yet another luxury tower containing 
yet more luxury apartments. The 
structures were purchased in 1985 for $43
million by Peter Kalikow, the real-estate de-
veloper, who announced plans to evict all of 
the tenants and replace the old build-
ings with four 40-story towers; the immensi-
ty of the public outcry against that proposal
led Mr. Kalikow to put forth a reduced plan
under which only one 65-story tower would be 
built, at the easternmost end of the site over-
looking the East River, and the rest of the 
complex would be retained. Tenants who
would lose their apartments to make way for
the new building would be moved into the sec-
tions of the project that were to be kept.
The revised plan, though it does call for sav-
ing the majority of the apartments, would still
cut the heart out of the complex. The old build-
ings, already hemmed in on many sides
by new apartment towers, would be over-
whelmed by the huge monolith on their own
site. The plan satisfied neither the tenants of 
the City and Suburban Homes nor a coalition of
community groups, who have continued to ob-
ject to Mr. Kalikow's project. The opponents
have succeeded in convincing the Land-
makrs Preservation Commission that the City
and Suburban Homes is a worthy candidate for 
landmark status, and the commission plans to 
hold a hearing on Thursday. If the build-
ings are so designated, Mr. Kalikow would 
need the commission's approval to proceed
with any version of his plan. 
Although the City and Suburban Homes'
somewhat similar neighbor, the Cherokee 
Apartments, has been a landmark for sev-
eral years, the City and Suburban 
Homes is not, at first glance, a typical city
landmark. The buildings are not beautiful by
conventional standards (although there is
some decorative detail on them, they are a 
goot bit less ornate than the Cherokee Apart-
ments, and their beige brick makes them
look plain, even banal, from the street).
Whether it is a matter of unintentional dis-
crimination against the poor or a more inno-
cent tendency to think of landmarks in terms
of the fantasies and dreams about the
city that they can inspire, New York has tend-
ed to favor elaborate buildings for landmark
status, either public structures or buildings de-k
signed for the rich. If you think of land-
marks only as celebrations of the city's roman-
tic imagery, there is not much that is romantic
about a tenement - even a modeltenement.
But no view could be more shortsighted, or 
more limiting of what landmark status
should signify. These structures, whichc were 
designed by several architectural forms of 
which the best known are Harde & Short and 
Percy Griffith, represent the city's best in-
tentions - a commitment on the part of the 
city's upper class, and its architects, to solv-
ing social problems. The City and Suburban 
Homes are not elegant in the way that so 
much of the city's turn-of-the-century archi-
tecture was elegant. But they are not bad as 
works of design, either. And no structures re-
flect nobler aspirations.
And today, if New York needs anything, it 
is some reminders that architecture can stand 
for the public good. For this is a time that is in 
one way not so very different from the era in 
which the City and Suburban Homes was built 
in both periods, the city's housing prob-
lem has been acute. In the early years of this 
century, the problem could be put mainly in 
terms of the quality of housing - conditions 
in the slums were appalling, and even most 
new buildings were constructed to stan-
dards that can obly be called indifferent to 
human needs. Now, housing units are more 
civilized - the problem is that we do not 
build enough of them, and that many people 
are without housing altogether. 
The most striking difference between the 
years the City and Suburban Homes was built 
and today is the extent to which in the earlier 
era the private esctor appeared commit-
ted to trying to solve the problem. The fam-
ilieswho organized the City and Suburban
Homes Company - which built smaller proj-
ects between its founding in 1896 and the start 
of the huge East 79th Street complex in 1901 - 
wanted not only to help the families who 
would live in their buildings but also to inspire
other, more profit-minded builders to raise 
the standards of their housing. They recog-
nized that the free market, acting on its own, 
would do little unless it was pushed. It 
would be another generation before the onset 
of public housing, bringing the government 
into the business of creating improved hous-
ing for the poor; until that time, the City
and Suburban Homes was the largest single 
effort in the New York or any other city to create 
decent housing for the poor. These apart-
ments are monuments to possibility - to the 
belief that architecture can make city life de-
cent for working people.
Today with only tiny amounts of publicly 
assisted housing being constructed, we seem 
in some ways to have slid almost all the way 
back to the era before City and Subur- 
ban Houses was even built, content to let the 
free market do what it wishes. That all too of- 
ten means building housing for the well-to-do, 
and letting others struggle as best they 
can. And where better to see that process at 
work than on the site of the City and Suburban 
Houses on the Upper East Side? It is ironic in-
deed that the City and Suburban Houses, 
a philanthropic testament to better housing 
conditions created because the real-estate 
market on its own could not do what was neces-
sary, might well be altered or destroyed by 
those very same market forces - come back 
to haunt it nearly a century later.
