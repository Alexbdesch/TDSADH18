&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By GAY TALESE


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a serene brownstone. <br/>
on Lexington Avenue, on the. <br/>
corner of Eighty-second Street,<br/>
a 59-year-old pharmacist named<br/>
Frederick  D.  Lascoff  has spe-<br/>
cialized for years  in  selling<br/>
leeches to battered prize-fight-<br/>
ers, catnip oil to lion hunters<br/>
and thousands of strange po-<br/>
tions to people in exotic places<br/>
around the world.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lascoff drugstore, which<br/>
celebrated its sixtieth anniver-<br/>
sary last week, is a  Gothic-<br/>
styled apothecary shop whose<br/>
walls are lined with more than<br/>
50,000 bottles containing every-<br/>
thing from Acacia to zinc.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be inferred from<br/>
the foregoing that Mr. Lascoff's<br/>
apothecary shop  carries  only<br/>
rare herbs and weird pills; far<br/>
from it. the bulk of its business <br/>
comes from standard prescrip-<br/>
tions. But through the years J.<br/>
Leon Lascoff & Son has made a<br/>
reputation for producing bi-<br/>
zarre concotions when re-<br/>
quested.<br/>
