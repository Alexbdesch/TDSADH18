&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Hylan, accompanied by the heads of many of the city departments, yesterday formally opened the municipally owned and operated ferry from East Ninety-second Street to Astoria. Civic and business organizations of Yorkville and Astoria, including 3,000 school children, joined in the celebration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Chambers of Commerce of Yorkville and Astoria and a deligation from the Real Estate Owner's Association of the 12th and 19th Wards met the Mayor and his official party at Pier A, Battery, and escorted them on board the sea-going tug John F. Hylan and the police boat Patrol. Accompanied by the reconstructed ferryboats Bowery Bay and Harlem, which are to be used in the new service, the official flotilla sailed around the end of Manhatten Island and up the East River to Ninety-second Street. All the way up the boats were greeted with the blasts of whistles from the river craft and the fire gongs along the shore were sounded.
