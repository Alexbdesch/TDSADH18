For the Markdown/HTML Practicum, the class will use GitHub to collaborate in creating a web site composed primarily of transcribed historical archives.
---

Choices to be made/Questions to Answer:

1. Do we focus on Markdown only (including small amounts of html)?

   If so, students will create and add (a) document(s) to their repository.
   Or, in addtion to markdown, they can also create an HTML page that links to their markdown.  This way, they can also experiment with CSS for styling.

2. What specific editing techniques should be explored?

   For example, if the students are transcribing newspaper articles, they might be asked to get as close to the original as possible by using headline text/font, indenting of paragraphs, lists with numbers, including photos, etc. 
   Are footnotes required? Optional?
   Other formatting requirements/options?

3. What item type(s) are acceptable/required?

   Newspaper articles?  Descriptions of physical items?  Letters/correspondence?  usw...
