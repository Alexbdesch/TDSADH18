<!-- 
This page is to be used as the template for your HTML page.  This content at the top is considered a "comment" and will not display
when the web page is viewed online. The "tags" that surround this text is what causes the text to be interpreted as a comment.  HTML
works via the use of tags, which usually come in pairs--an opening tag and a closing tag. Comments are used in the rest of this page 
to desribe the code that follows each comment.

<!--
The next line is a a special tag that is not really HTML. It tells web browsers that the rest of this page is a particular type of HTML
(the current version is HTML 5), so the browser knows how to display the content. It does not have a closing tag.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
Now the actual HTML tags start. Notice that the next tag (<html>) tells the browser "here is where the HTML starts."  At the bottom of this 
document, you will this tag: </html>.  The forward slash (/) is HTML code for "end."  Almost all HTML tags come in pairs like this.
-->
<html>
  	
	<!--The <head> tag sets the header for the page. Headers include metadata that indicate what type of formatting should be used,
	among other things. Also note that indenting is used each time an opening  tag is used, then the indenting is reduced when the 
	closing tag is used. This helps make the page more clear to the coder.-->
	<head> 
		
		<!--The next tag metadata tag instructing browsers to use the Unicode protocol for interpreting characters. Unicode is a 
		common standard that is used for virtually all web pages. This tag does not have a closing tag.-->

		<!--The next tag is another special tag; this one tells the page where to find formatting instructions.  The instructions
		are in anoteher file in this repository. The file is a "Cascading Style Sheet", in the "styles" folder. The file name
		ends with ".css" and contains HTML code in a special format.  It is what determines the font size and color, what a 
		link should look like, what the margins of the page should be, what the background should look like--in fact, every visual
		element of the page. (Browsers have default values that will be used if the style sheet does not explicitly say what to
