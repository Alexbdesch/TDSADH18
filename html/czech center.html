      <br> When proud immigrants built the 
      <br>Bohemian National Hall in 1896,
      <br>no one foresaw the tumultuous century 
      <br>that would follow in their homeland overseas, 
      <br>and in the hall's internal affairs. The building 
      <br>became a magnet for Czech nationalists from Bohemia, 
      <br>a medieval kingdom that fell under Hapsburg rule. 
      <br>In the aftermath of World War I, 
      <br>the Czechs won independence, but Nazi Germany 
      <br>dismembered Czechoslovakia, which later fell to the Communists. 
      <br>Democracy was restored in 1989, and in 1992, the nation split 
      <br>into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
      <br>The hall, at 321 E. 73d Street, outlasted all that -- surviving, barely, 
      <br>its own misfortunes, feuds and scandals.
      <br>"We almost lost it," said Jan Hird Pokorny, the president of the Bohemian
      <br>Benevolent and Literary Association, which owns the hall.
      <br> Now the landmarked five-floor facade is being restored. Supporters have raised 
      <br>$99,000 of the $5 million needed to renovate the interior, 
      <br>including a 100-foot-long, two-story ballroom. They envision an ethnic 
      <br>restaurant, social and cultural events, 
      <br>a display on the great Czech composer Antonin Dvorak 
      <br>(who performed to raise money for the original hall) and businesses.

      <br>"In the 80's things looked pretty bleak," said Peter Kutil, a co-chairman of the fund-raising effort. 
      <br>"The underlying problem was the center was for a community that was no longer there. 
      <br>We're trying very hard to bring back not only the building but activity in the Czechoslovak-American community, 
      <br>tied in overseas."Thousands of Czechs migrated to the Lower East Side in the late 1800's, 
      <br>then moved to work in Yorkville's cigar factories. Their hall, expanded by an annex and an adjoining movie theater,
      <br>drew sports, educational, cultural and social groups. But then the Czechs dispersed, to Astoria and the suburbs. 
      <br>Ethnic ties weakened with assimilation and conflicting views of later immigrants.

      <br>The hall spiraled into decline.  In the 1980's, its movie theater was sold and demolished. Some association leaders tried to sell the main hall, 
      <br>but others protested, prompting years of litigation . "That's all in the past," said Mr. Pokorny. 
      <br>Though the association has fallen to 15 member groups from 95, he says it has a new spirit of unity and optimism.
      <br>There are still critics. John Krondl, the publisher of Czechoslovak News, said it was "unforgivable" that the association took a year
      <br>and a half to prepare its first fund-raising letter, mailed a few days ago. Mr. Kutil said it needed the time to perfect its appeal.
