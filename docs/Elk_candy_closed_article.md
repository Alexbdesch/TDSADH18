86th Street Loses German Holdout And Its Marzipan
===

&nbsp;Customers spilled out of Elk Candy onto
the sidewalk in front of 240 East 86th Street
a week before Easter. More than 500 a day 
were coming for homemade marzipan and chocolate confections -- bunnies, eggs and 
pigs. A sign in the window said the 64-year-
old shop was closing for good.
   
&nbsp;''The line wouldn't break,'' said Anton 
Lulgjuraj, the 24-year-old owner, who inherited 
the shop from his father.

&nbsp;All that was left on the shelves that bleak, 
snowy afternoon were paper doilies and a 
few boxes of prepackaged chocolates. Relatives 
and friends helped him clean up and 
move fixtures and machinery into storage.

&nbsp;Elk, which closed last Monday, was the 
last holdout of the Montgomery, a row of 
four-story tenements built in 1883, and the 
penultimate vestige of German Broadway, 
as East 86th Street was known. Dozens of 
German establishments, including Kleine
Konditorei, Cafe Geiger, the Lorelei dance 
hall, the Platzl restaurant and Cafe Wienecke,
are gone. Only Ideal Restaurant is left
on 86th Street, between First and Second
Avenues, where it relocated two years ago
after a fire. Several German establishments
remain in other parts of Yorkville.
